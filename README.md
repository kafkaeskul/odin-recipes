This project is about how to build a new repository on gitHub and how to move the repo to your local machine.
Certain git commands are necessary such as mkdir, cd, code etc.
Lastly it is about the best practice of commits. How to name and describe them so that other developers can get a better understanding of the commit and when is a good moment to commit.
